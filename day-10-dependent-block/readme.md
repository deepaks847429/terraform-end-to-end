## dependent block in terrraform

- In very simple terms, Terraform manages dependencies to decide in which order to create or delete things in your infrastructure.

Imagine you're cooking a meal. Some things need to be done before others. For example:

First, you have to buy groceries.

Then, you prepare ingredients.

Then, you cook.

Finally, you serve the food.

If you try cooking without buying groceries first, you'll run into trouble. Similarly, Terraform uses dependencies to make sure things happen in the right order.

How Terraform understands dependencies:
Terraform understands two types of dependencies:

- 1. Implicit Dependencies (Automatic)
Terraform is smart enough to automatically know about dependencies if you use information from one resource to create another.

Example in plain terms:

You rent an apartment first.

Then you register your new address with the electricity company.
(You can't register without first knowing where your apartment is.)

Example in Terraform code:


Copy
Edit
resource "aws_instance" "my_server" {
  ami           = "some-ami-id"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "aws_eip" "my_ip" {
  instance = aws_instance.my_server.id  # using info from the server
}
In the above case:

Terraform automatically knows it must create the aws_instance first.

Then it creates the Elastic IP (aws_eip) because it needs the server's ID.

- 2. Explicit Dependencies (depends_on)
Sometimes, Terraform can't automatically understand the dependency. You must manually tell it to wait for one resource before creating another.

Example in plain terms:

You want to paint a wall, but first, your friend needs to finish plastering it.

Painting doesn't directly require information from your friend's plastering job, but you must explicitly wait.

Example in Terraform code:

hcl
Copy
Edit
resource "aws_instance" "my_server" {
  ami           = "some-ami-id"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "null_resource" "configure_server" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo Configuring server!"
  }

  depends_on = [aws_instance.my_server]  # explicitly wait until the server is ready
}
Here, Terraform doesn't know automatically that you must configure after creating the server because you're not directly using its information. So you explicitly tell Terraform to wait by using depends_on.

Simple Summary:
Terraform manages resources in a particular order.

Usually, Terraform figures out this order by itself (implicit).

Sometimes, you need to manually specify it using depends_on (explicit).

That's it!
