# Why: The state file may contain sensitive information (e.g., passwords, secret keys), so itâ€™s important to protect it from unauthorized access.

# Encryption: Use encryption for remote storage (e.g., S3 encryption).

# Access Control: Use IAM roles/policies for controlling who can read/write the state file.
